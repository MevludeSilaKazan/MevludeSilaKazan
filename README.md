# Full Stack Developer Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm @MevludeSilaKazan. This GitHub repository is created to showcase my skills and experiences as a full stack developer. Below, you can find a summary of my skills and experiences.

## Technical Skills ðŸ‘€

- Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#
- Web Framework: Django
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Artificial Intelligence

## Experience and Projects ðŸŒ± 

- **Web Development**: I have experience in both front-end and back-end development. I can create modern and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I can develop powerful and scalable web applications using the Django framework.

- **Artificial Intelligence**: I have worked on several projects related to artificial intelligence and have enhanced my experience in this field. I have worked on machine learning and deep learning projects, implementing various algorithms (such as classification, regression, clustering, neural networks) using Python. I have also utilized popular libraries (such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for data analysis. In these projects, I have followed steps like data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of results.

- **Machine Learning**: I have experience in machine learning projects and have been involved in various projects. Using Python, I have implemented various machine learning algorithms (such as classification, regression, clustering, neural networks) and utilized popular libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for data analysis. I have been involved in tasks such as data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of results.

- **Distributed Systems**: I have participated in projects related to distributed systems and have worked on them. I have a good understanding of this domain, including designing distributed system architectures and optimizing performance.

- **Database**: I have experience in managing databases. I have worked with popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I can create data models and optimize queries in these databases.

- **Data Structures**: I have experience in working with data structures and have implemented them in various projects. I have worked on designing and implementing data structures such as binary search trees, AVL trees, graph structures, and various types of linked lists (doubly linked list, circular linked list). I have utilized these data structures for data management and performance optimization.

- **API Integration**: I have experience in integrating APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to enable data communication between different systems and services. I have worked with popular APIs for tasks like data retrieval, data submission, and data updates.

- **Messaging Systems**: I have experience in using messaging systems for communication between software components. I have worked with technologies such as message queues, event-driven architecture, and publish-subscribe models to manage data flow and enable message-based communication.

- **Socket Programming**: I have knowledge and experience in establishing data communication over networks using TCP/IP or UDP protocols. I can utilize socket APIs to establish connections, send and receive data.

## Working Approach âœ¨ 

- Coding: I can write code according to given requirements and generate well-structured code adhering to best practices.
- Debugging: I can test written code, identify errors, and resolve them.
- Communication: I can communicate effectively and collaborate with project teams or clients when necessary.
